Web app that helps users answer the age old question

NOTE: Micah 5/20/20
Current site status. Framework is set to handle bridges and their locations.
Main site page currently has "Random Bridge" button and "Closest Bridge" button
"Closest Bridge" button does not currently work. It only takes the user to the bridge with ID of 1
However, the view and url are set up to support the functionality once the problem of getting user
coords and passing on to to the view is worked out.
5 MD bridges have been manually loaded to the heroku site database for testing purposes.
